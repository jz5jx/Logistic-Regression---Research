Using the reduced model with predictors GP, PTS, and FTA we found that our logistic regression and classification model was able to distinguish between classes with accuracy 73.44%. The implications of this can be used for future predictions on rookie careers in the NBA. This can be useful for general NBA scouts and evaluators when they are assessing new players. Though more generally, this process details how we can use predictors in our data to predict a binary response. This in turn can be utilized in many other different appliactions than just sports.
